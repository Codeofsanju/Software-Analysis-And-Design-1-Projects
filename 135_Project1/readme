CSCI 135 - Project 1

The main purpose of this assignment was to get familiar with the various loops in c++. We also practice the use of the modulo.


Task 1. printReactangle

A program that asks the user to input two positive integers, call them “width” and “height”. After that, the program should print out a rectangle of dot '.' characters with the requested width and height.

If some input numbers happened to be non-positive, don’t print anything.

Example:

Please, enter the width = 12
Please, enter the height = 7
............
............
............
............
............
............
............


Task 2. printGraph

A modification of the previous task. Again, the program asks the user to input two positive integers.

Then it should print a rectangle of '.', but now every 5th row and every 5th column should be printed with the hash '#' character instead of '.'.

For this problem, I make use of the modulo operator (%).

Example:

Please, enter the width = 19
Please, enter the height = 13

Task 3. Graph paper


Task 3: printGraphPaper
The same as the previous task, but the horizontal lines are drawn with dashes '-', the vertical lines are drawn with the vertical bars '|', and their intersections drawn with pluses '+'.


Example:

Please, enter the width = 19
Please, enter the height = 13
+----+----+----+---
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   
+----+----+----+---
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   
+----+----+----+---
|    |    |    |   
|    |    |    |   


Task 4. printDiamond

Ask the user to input a positive odd integer.

The will keep asking until the input integer is indeed odd and positive.

Assuming that the input number is N, the program prints a diamond that has the height N and the width N.

Example:

Please, enter a positive odd number: 10
Please, enter a positive odd number: -3
Please, enter a positive odd number: 7
