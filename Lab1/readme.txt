LAB #1: if/if else, switch, and enumeration (enum) types.

Task 1: computeRoot - A program that computes the roots of a quadratic equation with integer coefficients.

    The program asks the user to enter the coefficients of the equation. I use standard input (cin) for this.

    Then, it prints out the roots, correctly handling three possible cases:

    a. when there are two roots,
    b. one root
    c. no roots

Task 2: classifyChar - A program that takes a char as input from user using cin, and classifies the character into the following groups:

    a. Parenthesis, '(' or ')'
    b. Square bracket, '[' or ']'
    c. Curly brace, '{' or '}'
    d. Plus, '+'
    f. Minus, '-'
    g. Digit, '0' - '9'
    h. Other

    Then the program prints out the name of the character group to which the input character belongs.
